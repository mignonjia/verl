Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nExample Solution:\nThe denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.\n\nThe solution is the correct one. You should rethink the problem in your own words when you solve it.\nProblem: How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?
